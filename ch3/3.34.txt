A:
Local values a0, a1, ..., a5 are stored in callee-saved registers.

B:
Local values a6 and a7 are stored on the stack.

C:
There are 8 local variables to be stored, but only 6 callee-saved registers. So
two local variables have to go on the stack instead. If they were stored in
caller-saved registers instead, they might be overriden when Q is called.
