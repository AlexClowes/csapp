A:
For the unprotected version, buf is at %rsp, v is at %rsp + 24.
For the protected version, buf is at %rsp + 16, v is at %rsp + 8, and the canary
value is at %rsp + 40.

B:
In the protected code, v is closer to the top of the stack than buf. This means
that a buffer overflow when writing to buf would not cause the value of v to be
corrupted.
