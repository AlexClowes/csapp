A:
If string t is longer than string s, the function will give an incorrect result.
B:
strlen(s) - strlen(t) is of type size_t, which is the same as the unsigned type
and hence is never negative. So the function will always report that string s is
longer, unless s and t have the same length.
C:
We can fix the code by casting the results of the 2 calls to strlen to type int,
or by testing if strlen(s) > strlen(t) instead.
