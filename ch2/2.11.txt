A:
For an array of length 2k + 1, the final values of first and last are both k.

B:
With first = last = k, the final call to inplace_swap is
inplace_swap(&a[k], &a[k])
then in the function inplace_swap, we have x and y both pointing to the same
location in memory, and so the first statement *y = *x ^ *y has the effect of
setting a[k] = 0.

C:
The problem can be fixed by using < instead of <= in the for loop.
