A:
asize is now of type int64_t, but it will then be cast to size_t, which uses
only 32 bits in the call to malloc. So the overflow bug is still present.
B:
The vulnerability could be eliminated by explicitly checking for the overflow,
and returning NULL if the multiplication would overflow. If asize has overflowed,
then it would not be possible to allocate that much memory in any case.

uint64_t asize = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
if (asize != (size_t) asize) {
    // Multiplication has overflowed, not possible to allocate this much memory 
    return NULL;
}
void *result = malloc(asize);
