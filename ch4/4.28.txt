A:
Placing a register between blocks C and D gives throughput of ~5.26GIPS and
latency of 380ps.

B:
Placing registers between B and C and between D and E gives throughput of
~7.69GIPS and latency of 390ps.

C:
Placing registers between A and B, C and D, D and E gives throughput of ~9.09GIPS
and latency of 440ps.

D:
If we place registers between every adjacent block except for E and F, we obtain
the maximum possible throughput of 10GIPS, with latency of 500ps.
